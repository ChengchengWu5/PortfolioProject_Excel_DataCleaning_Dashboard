### This project cleans data in Excel Power Query and then creates a dashboard for visualization based on the cleaned dataset. For data cleaning, it involves 
- standardizing columns (i.e. the Marital Status, Gender, and Commute Distance columns)
- adding a column (the Age Range column in this case) which is culculated based on the Age column using the nested IF function
- handling missing data (e.g. cells with N/a and NaN)

For visualization, it creates a Pivot Table to analyze the cleaned dataset before creating the interactive dashboard with visuals and slices.

### Data source:
- Kaggle
